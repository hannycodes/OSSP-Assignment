# OSSP-Assignment
This repository contains my OSSP assignment and system call implementation.

**Part A: OS Installation**

I installed Xubuntu 24.10 LTS on VMware workstation. The process i used involved creating a virtual machine with custom RAM and disk settings. I took screenchots throughout the process to document each step.

**Part B: System call**

I implemented a system call in the linux kernel to remove an empty directory. It involved first creating an empty directory then removing it.
